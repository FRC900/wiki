We found out many things about our mill and hsmworks!

  *  It uses a bt30 collet

  *  To set the height at which it changes tools, you have to go to the DRO screen and jog it to the place you want, then back into ref position (I think it's that one)

  *  You can use the 2d contour operation in hsmworks to cut pockets from tube, but make sure to reverse them so that the arrows are in the air (for pockets, that's on the inside of the contour)

  *  When using 2d contour, select the bottom edge of what you want to cut.

  *  To make the view of the cnc program top down, you have to go out of the program and in the verify menu you can view the toolpath and set it to xy

  *  The cnc machine won't cut circles with a 2d contour, but will triangles
