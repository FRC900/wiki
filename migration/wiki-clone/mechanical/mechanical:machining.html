====== In House Machining ======


===== Fusion F400 Printer =====
  * Size: 14"x14"x14"
  * Enclosure: Yes
  * Lots of filament types can be used
  * Marshall's personal printer but kept at the lab for team use
  * [[mechanical:3D Printing|Usage]]
===== Prusa i3 MK3 =====
  * Size: 25x21x20cm
  * Enclosure: No
  * Marshall's personal printer, kept at home but travels with the team to events
  * Main filaments: PLA and TPU
====== FabLab Machining ======

===== ShopBot =====
  * PRSAlpha 48x96
  * 4HP Spindle, 18K RPM Max
  * Pneumatic Drill attachment head
==== Pneumatic Drill ====
  * Concentric bearings for alignment of the drill need to be adjusted if the drill bit is walking around/deflecting
  * Pressure really needs to be 90PSI or higher and the flow valve needed to be opened on the vertical piston (This is an issue in the Fablab in that pressure maxes out at 90PSI on the wall mounted regulators)
  * Zero routine for the drill is in the C:/Sbparts folder and requires running on every bit change (bit changes on either the drill or the spindle) as the value is calculated as an offset between the two.
    * The routine for zeroing the spindle (NOT THE DRILL) needs to be run first
  * Something weird happens if you stop pneumatic drill operations with ShopBot Software and it might require you to restart the machine and then re-zero everything over again.
  * Finding the XY offsets for the pneumatic drill system is done using the normal ShopBot setup routine.
  * .25 inch holes are TOO large for a single pass drilling operation and seem to pull the part up off the table (peck drilling or center drilling first should be required)
===== Laser Cutter =====
small, accurate, has ventilation for poly
===== ShopBot Desktop =====
medium size, not too slow, accurate
===== CNC Mill =====
  * Prototrak DPM2
  * [[mechanical:Prototrak|Prototrak notes]]
===== CNC Lathe =====
