======Curriculum======

Within each of the following pages, there are multiple topics that you have to learn by the end of preseason. For each topic, there is a "To learn" section and a "To do" section. The To learn section is usually a link to a presentation, which you should absolutely read in its entirety. The To do section is a short project that usually involves submitting something to Olivia or Adam via Slack. Work through these pages in order, because they do build upon each other.

Everyone on the programming team is doing the same tasks as you are, so please reach out to a lead, a team member, or the #ros channel if you are in any way lost or confused. It's probably more the fault of bad instruction than anything else, so just tell us and we'll give you more bad instruction as you need it! Always here to help.
