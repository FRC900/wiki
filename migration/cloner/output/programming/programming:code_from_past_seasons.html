======Code From Past Seasons======

This page archives our code from past seasons.

====2013, Ultimate ascent:====
In 2013, we used java and had some code issues at competition. Our code from competition can be found [[https://github.com/FRC900/DriveCode2013|here]]. Immediately following that competition, we rewrote our drive code in LabVIEW. That code can be found [[https://github.com/FRC900/Inky-LabVIEW|here]].

====2014, Aerial Assist:====
Our 2014 code can be found [[https://github.com/FRC900/2014RobotCode|here]], which includes code to control a tank drive and basic image processing of a single frame on the cRIO.

====2015, Recycle Rush:====
Our 2015 robot featured a swerve drive and automatic recycling bin recognition using a NVIDIA Jetson TK1 co-processor. Our robot code can be found [[https://github.com/FRC900/2015RobotCode|here]], and our vision code can be found [[https://github.com/FRC900/2015VisionCode|here]].

====2016, Stronghold:====

Our 2016 code went through 2 major rewrites due to issues with LabVIEW's command and control structure updating in the middle of the season. Our first code branch stopped working after LabVIEW updated mid-season, and it can be found [[https://github.com/FRC900/2016RobotCode|here]]. This was followed by a rewrite without using non-command and control found [[https://github.com/FRC900/2016WorkingCode|here]]. Our third rewrite was reimplementing command and control and cleaning up the code in general, and can be found [[https://github.com/FRC900/2016Robot|here]]. Our vision system for tracking the goal can be found [[https://github.com/FRC900/2016VisionCode|here]].

====2017, Steamworks:====
Our 2017 controls code can be found [[https://github.com/FRC900/2017RobotCode|here]] and our 2017 vision code can be found [[https://github.com/FRC900/2017VisionCode|here]].

====2018, Power Up:====
In 2018, we transitioned from LabVIEW to C++ for our entire robot code. We also switched from using ROS for vision to using ROS for everything. All of the code is in one repository, and it can be found [[https://github.com/FRC900/2018RobotCode|here]].

====2019, Deep Space (Presented by the Boing Company):====
In 2019, we continued to improve our ROS-based robot.  Code is more modular, better planned and organized.  A big feature was offloading much of the processing to the Jetson TX2, including CAN motor control and status. All of the code is in one repository, and it can be found [[https://github.com/FRC900/2019RobotCode|here]].
