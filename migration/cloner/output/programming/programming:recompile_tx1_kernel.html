(Page describing the process for recompiling the kernel for the TX1.)

====== Recompiling the TX1 Kernel ======

This was done on a ubuntu 16.04 system running as a virtual machine. You need 50GB of freespace, FYI. It’s a cross-compile environment and makes this whole process a lot faster.

  * Start by pulling down the sources and the L4T documentation from Nvidia (see links below).\\

  * Read the “Building the NVIDIA Kernel” section.\\

  * It will point you to downloading and installing toolchains for ARM64.\\

  * You need BOTH toolchains.\\

  * Before you run the setup scripts for the toolchains, run this to get the extra packages: “apt-get install gawk texinfo automake libtool g++”.

Clean install of latest L4T on the Jetson. Dont change it other than that.

You have to export some configurations (The first one isn’t incomplete, it’s a prefix)

  * ''%%$ export CROSS_COMPILE=/home/ubuntu/Desktop/workspace/toolchain/toolchain-build-aarch64/install/bin/aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu-%%''
  * ''%%$ export CROSS32CC=/home/ubuntu/Desktop/workspace/toolchain/toolchain-build-armhf/install/bin/arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi-gcc%%''
  * ''%%$ export TEGRA_KERNEL_OUT=/home/ubuntu/Desktop/workspace/sources/kernel_out/%%''
  * ''%%$ export ARCH=arm64%%''
  * ''%%$ cd <myworkspace>/<kernel_source>%%''
  * ''%%$ mkdir $TEGRA_KERNEL_OUT%%''
  * ''%%$ make O=$TEGRA_KERNEL_OUT tegra21_defconfig%%''
  * Edit the .config file to enable NVME (CONFIG_BLK_DEV_NVME=y) and possibly set a CONFIG_LOCALVERSION extension for the kernel
  * ''%%$ make O=$TEGRA_KERNEL_OUT zImage%%''
  * ''%%$ make O=$TEGRA_KERNEL_OUT dtbs%%''
  * ''%%$ make O=$TEGRA_KERNEL_OUT modules%%''
  * ''%%$ mkdir /home/ubuntu/Desktop/workspace/sources/kernel_out/modules_out%%''
  * ''%%$ make O=$TEGRA_KERNEL_OUT modules_install INSTALL_MOD_PATH=/home/ubuntu/Desktop/workspace/sources/kernel_out/modules_out%%''
  * ''%%Copy DTB files from here: /homt/ubuntu/Desktop/workspace/sources/kernel_out/arch/arm64/boot/dts/%%''
  * ''%%Copy Image and zImage from here: /homt/ubuntu/Desktop/workspace/sources/kernel_out/arch/arm64/boot/%%''
  * ''%%Copy /lib/modules/<uname -r> from /home/ubuntu/Desktop/workspace/sources/kernel_out/modules_out%%''

Verify that the DTB file you are replacing in /boot/extlinux/extlinux.conf is correct.

Reboot and deal with the inevitable errors the first time you do this.
