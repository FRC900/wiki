======Fasteners======
====Rivets====

  * Connects two flat pieces through compression
  * Main connection device used on the robots

^ Size of Rivet   ^ 5/32 ^ 3/16 ^
| Shear Strength | 190 lbs | 330 lbs |
| Tensile Strength | 230 lbs | 515 lbs |
| Drill Size | #20 | #11 |

===Instalation method===
  - Dry Fit the pieces together
    - Use Clecos to temporarily fasten
  - Once aligned place a few rivets in the holes
  - Use the rivet gun to compress the rivet
  - Throw out the rivet tail

===Removal method===
  - Grab the 5/32 drill bit 
  - Drill through the hole in the center of the rivet
  - Use a vacuum to clean the hole







====Bolts====

Bolts provide more strength than a rivet in the hundreds of pounds. Bolts require something to screw into in order to provide this strength. In a normal situation, you should use a Nylock in order to keep the bolt in compression even while being jostled in operation. In the event that a Nylock cannot be used you need to put Blue Loctite on the bolt in order to provide the effect of the Nylock. 

Note: Loctite will remove the structural integrity of Lexan so make sure not to mix the two.

We have a standard bolt size of #8 and should be used as often as possible. When more strength is required from the bolt you should use #10.
====Glue====

Epoxy is good and perfect for use with Lexan. Its just glue it is weak but can be useful.
