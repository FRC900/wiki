  - **Chain**
  - **CIM*- 1. A 12v DC motor for powering drivetrain or other large mechanisms. Pronounced "SIM". Depending on whom you ask this stands for **CCL*- **I**ndustrial **M**otors or **C**ontrolled **I**nduction **M**otor. For FIRST, manufactured by Vex Robotics.

  - **Jetson**-low power processing board made by NVIDIA for accelerated machine learning applications
  - **miniCIM*- 1. A 12v DC motor for powering drivetrain or other large mechanisms. Pronounced "SIM". Depending on whom you ask this stands for **CCL*- **I**ndustrial **M**otors or **C**ontrolled **I**nduction **M**otor. For FIRST purposes, manufactured by Vex Robotics. The miniCIM has a similar size but approximately 2/3 the power and 2/3 the length.

We don't use it for much of anything but it is required to be on the robot.
  - **Safety Light**-orange light found on the robot which indicates if robot is on (light is on) and if robot is engaged (light is blinking) 
  - **Solenoid valve**-device using electrical currents and magnetic fields to open and close valves, directing fluids and gasses often in pneumatic or hydraulic systems
  - **Spacer**
  - **Sprocket**
  - **Talon SRX*- 1. A CAN-bus compatible motor controller
  - **Versaplanetary*- 1. A modular planetary gearbox compatible with CIMs, Mini CIMs, and other common FRC motors. Can be configured with any number of gear reductions.
  - **Versaframe**
  - **VRM**
  - **ZED**
  - **775pro**
**Tools**
  - **Allen key*- 1. The L-shaped tool with a hexagonal shape used for tightening (and loosening!) bolts with hex heads
  - **Band saw*- 1. a power tool that uses a ribbon-like saw that has been welded into a loop. {{ :bandsaw-main-parts.jpg?200|}}
  - **CNC*- 1. **C**omputer **N**umerical **C**ontrol 1. a catch-all term for machines that use instructions (G-Code) providing the coordinates for movement of cutting or deposition tool heads.
  - **CNC mill*- 1. A programmable mill for cutting metal with high precision
  - **Drill*- 1. A typically handheld power tool that uses spiral cutters (drill bits) to make holes of various sizes.
  - **Lathe*- 1. A machine for shaping wood, metal, or other material by means of a rotating drive which turns the piece being worked on against changeable cutting tools.
  - **Screwdriver*- 1. A handheld tool for tightening or loosening screws. Many types and sizes are possible: Philips, Flat Head, Posidrive, Square Drive, etc.
  - **ShopBot*- 1. A brand of CNC router used for cutting wood, acrylic, and soft metals
  - **Wrench*- 1. A handheld tool for tightening or loosening bolts
**Mechanisms and Systems**
  - **Arm**
  - **Catapult**
  - **Elevator**
  - **Intake*- 1. the component of the robot that grabs or picks up game pieces (usually ball-like)
  - **Pneumatics*- 1. use of pressurized air to power mechanisms
  - **Pulley**
  - **Swerve Module**
  - **West Coast Drive**
  - **Wheeled shooter**
**Design**
  - **CAD**-aka computer-aided design; a way of designing, depicting, and assembling various parts virtually
  - **Chamfer*- An angled cutaway on a right-angle edge or corner to make a symmetrical beveled edge
  - **Drawing*- 1. A 2D view of the piece being constructed
  - **Extrude*- 1. The process of stretching a plane into the third dimension. Drawings are typically created in 2D and then extruded up into 3D. A square of 2x2mm, for instance, can be extruded by 2mm to form a 2x2x2mm cube.
  - **Fillet*- 1. Similar to a chamfer except instead of a fixed angle, the result is a rounded edge. The roundness of the edge is defined by the diameter specified.
  - **Pocketing*- 1. The process of carving a holiday or recess in a plane so that something can sit nestled inside
  - **Sketch**
**Controls**

**Vision*- 
 - **LIDAR**

**FIRST Vernacular**

  - **Coopertition*- 1. A word combining "cooperation" and "competition". It embodies the aspirations of FRC as an aggressive team game while also reminding us all of the shared learning experience that is brought about by thrill of competing.
  - **FRC*- 1. Acronym for *First Robotics Competition*. A program that allows high school students to experience engineering and programming through the excitement of sport.
  - **FTC*- 1. Acronym for *First Tech Challenge*. A program for students grade 7-12 that grants hands-on experience with designing, programming, and building a robot for a game.
  - **FLL*- 1. Acronym for *First Lego League*. A competition open for elementary and middle school students that creates engaging problems that must be overcome with problem solving, coding, and engineering skills.
  - **FLL Jr.*- 1. Acronym for *First Lego League Jr.* A program that sets up STEM opportunities for students PreK-1. This program seeks to inspire students to solve real world problems with research, critical thinking, and most importantly, their imagination.
  - **Chairman's Award*- 1. A __highly prestigious__ award that honors the team whom best embodies the principles of FIRST through their actions both in and outside the competition. Teams that have received Chairman's Awards at Regional or District Championships are able to travel to the World Championship and be considered for the Chairman's Award. A brief summary of this deed is read aloud during the awards ceremony prior to it being gifted to a team. You can find out more about this and other awards on the [[https:*www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/frc/submitted-awards|FIRST Website]]
  - **Regional*- 1. A competition that contains teams encompassing the states nearby??
  - **District*- 1. 
  - **World Champions*- 1. A competition that a select few teams can participate in.
