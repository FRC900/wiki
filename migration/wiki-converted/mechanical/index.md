This Wiki is by no means complete and while there is an edit list at the bottom of this page there are many things that have been overlooked or could be added to so feel free to add whatever you would feel is necessary.

[Machining](mechanical:Machining)\\

This section lists the electronics required on an FRC robot, the layout in which they should be wired, and installation techniques. 

[Pneumatics](mechanical:systems:pneumatic)\\
This section contains reference information about pneumatics: what they are, when to use them, how to use them, and circuit symbols.
