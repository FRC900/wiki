# Drivetrains# 


## What is a drivetrain?## 
A drivetrain will serve as the most important part of your robot, without it the robot would not be able to move! As one could assume we want the drivetrain to be reliable and consistent. The key characteristics of a drivetrain include reliability, consistency, functionality, effectiveness, and efficiency. When you build your drivetrain it is very important to consider what you will need to prevail in that year's game. For example; if FIRST makes the field floor out of corn it would be wise to have a drivetrain with a lot of traction. There are two groupings of drivetrains that are commonly used in FRC which are Tank and Holonomic. This document was written with inspiration from {{ :mechanical:roboting_10.99.pdf |}}.

## Tank Drives## 
Tank is a drivetrain in which each side is powered and able to move independently. Tank drive is the most common type of drivetrain in FRC.

### Four Wheel Tank### 
{{:mechanical:6a00d83451706569e20147e21c3947970b.jpg?300|}}
  - Left and Right sides can be driven independently 
  - Most common format is two traction wheels and two omni wheels
  - Very uncommon to see at competitions
  - __**Pros:**__ Simple to build, design, and program.
  - __**Cons:**__ Large turning radius and least traction of all tank drives (still decent amount though).

### Six Wheel Tank###

  - Left and Right sides can be driven independently 
  - Most common FRC drivetrain
  - Kit Of Parts drivetrain
  - __**Pros:**__ Durable; Simple to build, degsign, and program. Inexpensive.
  - __**Cons:**__ Being the most common you are equally matched with other robot's drivetrains often. Possible wheel scrub problems. Slight rocking due to dropped center wheels.

### Six Wheel Omni Tank### 
{{:mechanical:screen_shot_2019-09-12_at_6.41.27_pm.png?200|}}
  - Dropped center omni wheels
  - Divides the effective wheel base
  - Reduces force on outer wheels
### Eight Wheel Tank### 
{{:mechanical:screen_shot_2019-09-09_at_7.25.54_pm.png?200|}}
  - Left and Right sides can be driven independently 
  - Dropped center wheels (two per side)
  - __**Pros:**__ Durable; Relatively simple to build, more traction, good at handling ramps/imperfections in the field.
  - __**Cons:**__ Custom build/serious modification required, greater likelihood wheel scrub problems. "Mo' wheels, mo' problems" -Brian Gray

## Holonomic Drives## 
In a holonomic drive has two degrees of translation and one degree of rotation.

### Mecanum### 
{{:mechanical:am-14u3-mk8-2_71.jpg?250|}}
  - Requires four independently powered wheels
  - Wheels must be installed correctly due to vectored rollers
  - Capable of full omnidirectional movement
  - __**Pros:**__ Easy to design and build, lots of sources for programming support available. Agile.
  - __**Cons:**__ No pushing force. Challenging to learn driving techniques. Costly due to wheels and extra gearboxes.

### Swerve###  
{{:mechanical:screen_shot_2019-09-12_at_6.21.10_pm.png?200|}}
  - Uses 4 independently powered traction wheel modules which rotate on a vertical  axis to control direction
  - Capable of full omnidirectional movement with a large amount of agility
  - __**Pros:**__ High speed and very agile
  - __**Cons:**__ Most complex and expensive drivetrain to design and build in FRC. Difficult programming and requires at least 8 motors. More opportunities for malfunction.
