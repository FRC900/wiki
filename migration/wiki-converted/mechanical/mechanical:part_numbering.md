**What is the PBS?**
  - PBS stands for Product Breakdown System
  - More often called Part Numbering Document
  - A spreadsheet that assigns a number to every part on the robot and tracks many attributes

**What does the part number mean?**
  - A part number is a 6 digit code for every part, assembly, and subassembly in the robot 
  - The format is ###-###
     - Ex: 100-000
     - Ex: 330-067
  - The first 3 digits denote the assembly 
     - First digit: top level assembly 
        - 0: Full robot
           - Ex: 000-000 Robot.sldasm
        - 1: Chassis
           - Ex: 100-000 Chassis.sldasm
        - 2:
        - 3:
        - 4:
        - Etc.
     - The next two digits are the subassembly
        - Ex: 110-000 corner 2019.sldasm
        - Ex: 111-000 swerve module.sldasm
  - The last 3 digits Identify the specific part
     - 000 is ALWAYS an assembly
        - Highlighted automatically based on assembly level
     - Parts count up from 001

**There’s a part number that doesn’t match this format!**
  - Don’t panic, it’s a COTS or modified part
  - Common formats from our suppliers:
     - AM 1. #### 	AndyMark	AM
     - 217 1. ####	VexPro		VEX
     - #####A###	McMaster-Carr	MCM
