#  Zebracorn Brand Guidelines # 

Just to make a note - ours WILL NOT be overly comprehensive because ~1/10 of most example branding guidelines actually apply to our team at this point. This document will only cover logo design and its importance, typeface, usage in different situations, and maybe a little stylistic reference. The color palette section will be actually something of a joke, but I promise it’ll look legitimate.\\

#  Why Our Brand is Important # 

\\
The primary purpose of the Zebracorn brand is to broadcast a consistent **identity*- for our team. The Zebracorn brand is not just the logo! Our brand includes the logo, the font, the colors we use, the clothes we wear at competition, the look and feel of our printed materials, paint colors we may use on robot parts, and even the slogans and chants we use.\\
\\
Keeping our presentation consistent is important. Team members, mentors, sponsors, etc. all need to know what constitutes a Zebracorn message. We want the people seeing our communications, our team members, inventions, etc. to immediately associate them with the Zebracorn image.\\
\\
Beyond the public message, the Zebracorn brand gives team members something to believe in and stand behind. It helps us understand the purpose of the team and the mission.\\
\\
#  Elements of Our Visual Identity # 

\\
Along with our publications, booklets, and emails, the team has a visual identity which sets apart from other teams. At competitions, we wear Zubaz zebra-striped pants with black t-shirts and black and white personalized jackets. The only thing which changes from year to year is our t-shirt, which features a game-inspired design on the front and a graphic of our sponsors on the back. When people visit our pit, we give out stickers instead of buttons which feature our logo. \\
\\
#  Branding and Logos # 

\\

When referring to ourselves, we will use “The Zebracorns” and not “Team 900”. (The verbs are conjugated as plural, ex. “The Zebracorns are…” not “The Zebracorns is…”). We will only use FRC Team 900 when navigating in the FIRST Community. These are the approved logos for the team. It is imperative that we keep our branding consistent and use only the following logos.\\

#  Typeface # 

\\

It may seem trivial but our typeface has some important jobs to do as a part of our brand. For most people a typeface is invisible but that doesn't mean it doesn't matter. Our typeface can be used to subtly attract and hold the reader's attention, make our copy easier to read, establish a hierarchy of information, emphasize or create harmony, and assist in strengthening our overall brand.\\
\\
Our typeface is Roboto. Roboto is the default Android font and is available as part of the G-Suite’s font chooser menu. Roboto is open source and available from github.com/google/roboto.\\
\\
Headers: Roboto Black\\
\\
Subheaders: Roboto Light\\
\\
Body Copy: Roboto Normal\\
\\
Code: Roboto Mono (10pt)\\
\\
Wherever possible, all communications should use the Roboto face. Some circumstances with digital communications may prevent using this font. You should attempt to import the font by embedding the following into your header.\\
\\
<head>*
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto" rel="stylesheet">\\
</head>\\
\\
If it is not possible to use the Roboto typeface (such as in email or web pages) it is acceptable to substitute Verdana or failover to sans-serif in CSS. \\
\\
font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;\\
\\
Note: our team logo is in Avenir typeface.\\
\\
#  Color Palette # 
{{:color_palette.png?400|}}\\
\\
8870FF: Pantone 272C\\
\\
The main colors are black and white. These should be used as the primary colors for design and marketing. The shades of purple serve as accent colors as a way to emphasize text or figures on a black and white page. For example://\

#  Web Applications # 

We have three social media platforms on which the team makes public posts: Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. The Instagram is set up \\

Facebook Page: The Zebracorns - FRC Team 900\\
\\
Instagram: team900\\
\\
Twitter: Zebracorns (@frc900)\\
\\
We use the hashtag #herdsighting for all of our posts on Instagram and Twitter, as well as any other relevant hashtags.\\ 
\\
We send a weekly email through Mailchimp to members of the team. We will send an email every two months to everyone, including sponsors, alum, and parents. The weekly email contains things like meeting topics, forms, upcoming events, and other things which are relevant for students to know. The bimonthly email covers what we have done since the last email (outreach, talks, technological advancements, etc.). The email template should be consistent from email to email, with only content changing between.\\
