###  Obsolete Links ## 

Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.  This is especially true in the world of The Zebracorns software team.  The following contains a link to a page with a bunch of obsolete information.  It is kept mostly for historical reasons, with the off chance there's still a bit of useful information.  But trust the code if it conflicts with anything in here.
