The Designer’s Award
This award celebrates a team’s outstanding success with the Game Design Challenge. The winner of this award was a strong candidate for other awards in this challenge category.

The judges were impressed with every component of this team’s farm. Their goals gave every team an opportunity to score; from pushing game pieces into scoring locations and parking in particular zones to throwing game pieces up and across the field. This game has the potential to become a reality! Congratulations to FRC 900, Zebracorns from Durham!

The Autonomous Award sponsored by Ford
This award celebrates the team that has demonstrated consistent, reliable, high-performance robot operation during autonomously managed actions. Evaluation is based on the robot’s ability to sense its surroundings, position itself or onboard mechanisms appropriately, and execute tasks.

The judges shared:
When it comes to developing autonomous functions, this team has really earned their stripes.
Using their arsenal of sensors, simulations, and a sweet swerve drive, they have galloped into first place.
With this herd’s advanced robot ideas, determination, and willingness to share their data with other teams, the concept of having a fully autonomous robot, might not be just a fantasy.
Congratulations Magnesium Group, FRC 900 Zebracorns from Durham.

Advancing FIRST Tech Challenge and FIRST Robotics Competition teams will join the FLL nominees to showcase their innovative solutions and vie for awards at the Global Innovation Awards powered by Star Wars: Force for Change, June 28-30, 2021. This remote event will be in front of FIRST Strategic Partners and a global audience of peers and industry leaders.

Here’s what the judges shared about our first FRC semi-finalist.
This team HORNED in on a key segment of fitness consumers to clearly identify the need for an innovative solution to reduce injuries. They RAN away from the competition with an integrated, feasible design and persuasive business pitch. The team earned their STRIPES by integrating business, design and market considerations into the SOUL of their plan.
